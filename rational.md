# Car Selection Exercise 
-------------------------

## description

The project is first and foremost a car brand and model selector powered by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Similar to pages often seen on car insurance sites.

-------------------------

## Rational

I kept the html and css svelte (not the framework lol) and leant more on JavaScript (JS), the reason for doing so is. I started this project creating a lot of html elements to contain information but as I thought the project through, I kept hitting mental roadblocks caused by one issue SCALABILITY!

I put myself in the shoes of a company, I donâ€™t want to be spending my developers precious time on inputting hefty amounts of html code because of new brands and models hitting the market not only bloating the code but creating chances for more bugs but also taking away time from other important issues. I used JS to essentially take data from the database (represented by arrays) where new models and brands can be inputted with speed and precision and use it to create option elements within the select elements that are responsive to changes made to said databases.

Now the basics for the project are complete I can focus on any creative additions I want to make to improve upon the current design.

### Given more time I would add:

+ Better responsiveness to the page for smaller screens.
+ A more scalable back-end e.g. using a database, allowing for easier inputing of new options without bloating the JS beyond maintainability.
+ Use of frameworks and libraries e.g. SASS and jQuery to reduce lines of code increasing readbility and if scaled to a business level reduce load time.

## Walkthrough of skills used

Although the webpage might not be as visually appealing as one might of hoped, as a developer in training my end goal was to showcase as many skills as possible within one project.

### Skills: 


+ Good imagination and spacial visualisation skills, demonstrated by the extensive manipulation of the DOM using JS to construct large portions of the site that need to be dynamic.

+ Use of built in methods, demonstrating good knowledge of codebase but also excellent ability to find and use documentation.

+ Good understanding of scope and the ability to use this to make complex code with multiple functions.

+ Excellent handle on the basics, although not being an exceptional skill setting me apart from the rest. I can transfer my understanding to new technologies making me a flexible developer.

+ My emphasis on building a dynamic webpage for the purposes of scalability shows an understanding of what is required in a business level setting.
